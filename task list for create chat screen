## Feature Implementation Breakdown

### Core Requirements Summary
Implement a WhatsApp-style chat interface that enables real-time conversational interactions between users and MiVia's Coaching AI. This feature provides personalized support, guidance, and motivation aligned with the four life pillars (Purpose, Health, Emotion, Connection), with timestamped message history for reflection and progress tracking.

### Key UX Considerations
- Chat interface should feel immediately familiar to WhatsApp users (message bubbles, input field, send button)
- Messages must be clearly distinguished between user and AI (left/right alignment, different colors)
- Smooth scrolling and automatic scroll-to-bottom for new messages
- Clear timestamps that don't clutter the interface
- Loading states for AI responses to manage user expectations
- Conversation context should persist across app sessions

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Data & Backend Implementation
  - [ ] 1.1 Create chat message data model with fields for: message content, sender (user/AI), timestamp, read status, and user ID
  - [ ] 1.2 Implement Supabase table for chat history with proper indexing for efficient message retrieval
  - [ ] 1.3 Set up real-time subscription for new messages to enable live updates
  - [ ] 1.4 Create API endpoints for sending messages and retrieving chat history with pagination
  - [ ] 1.5 Implement data retention policy (store messages securely, handle deletion if needed)

- [ ] 2.0 Core Functionality
  - [ ] 2.1 Implement message sending flow: user types → sends → stores in database → triggers AI response
  - [ ] 2.2 Integrate with AI coaching service to generate contextual responses based on user's pillar data and chat history
  - [ ] 2.3 Add typing indicator when AI is generating a response
  - [ ] 2.4 Implement chat history loading with pagination (load recent messages first, older messages on scroll)
  - [ ] 2.5 Handle offline scenarios - queue messages for sending when connection returns
  - [ ] 2.6 Add context awareness - AI should reference user's habits, progress, and pillar scores

- [ ] 3.0 User Interface Implementation
  - [ ] 3.1 Create main chat view with WhatsApp-style message bubbles (user messages right-aligned, AI left-aligned)
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement input field with send button, keyboard handling, and multi-line support
  - [ ] 3.3 Add timestamp display logic (show on tap or at regular intervals to avoid clutter)
  - [ ] 3.4 Create loading states: initial chat history load, AI response generation, message sending
  - [ ] 3.5 Implement auto-scroll to latest message with smooth animation
  - [ ] 3.6 Add pull-to-refresh for loading older messages
  - [ ] 3.7 Handle empty state for new users with welcoming AI message
  - [ ] 3.8 Ensure proper keyboard avoidance and input field positioning

- [ ] 4.0 Integration & Polish
  - [ ] 4.1 Connect chat to user's pillar data so AI can provide personalized guidance
  - [ ] 4.2 Add navigation from other app areas (e.g., "Ask AI" buttons in habit tracking)
  - [ ] 4.3 Implement notification support for AI responses when app is backgrounded
  - [ ] 4.4 Test message delivery reliability, typing indicators, and real-time updates
  - [ ] 4.5 Ensure chat history syncs properly across device sessions
  - [ ] 4.6 Add error handling for network failures, AI service unavailability
  - [ ] 4.7 Implement accessibility features (VoiceOver support for messages, dynamic text sizing)

### Notes
- The AI should maintain conversational context and reference previous discussions
- Consider implementing message reactions or quick reply suggestions in future iterations
- Ensure all messages are encrypted and stored securely in compliance with privacy requirements
- The chat should feel responsive even with slower AI response times through proper loading states
